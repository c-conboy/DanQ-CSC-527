### About
DanQ is a hybrid convolutional and recurrent deep neural network which predicts non-coding functionof DNA sequences. The model was developed in 2016 and achieved considerable performance improvements to comparable solutions.BioQ, is a modern reimplementation of DanQ, which applies the original paperâ€™s methodology (model architecture and training procedure) with up-to-date machine learning frameworks. BioQ achieved similar results to the original paper and introduced nice-to-have usability features.
